## This repository contains two ROS2-based robotics tasks implemented using ROS 2 Humble:

- **Task 1**: Simulating a 2-wheel differential drive robot with sensors in Gazebo and navigating using Nav2.

- **Task 2**: Computing odometry from simulated wheel encoder ticks.

## Steps to Execute each package is given inside the    `` --src ``
Instructions to remove ```build/```, ```install/```, ```log/``` before building your workspace
